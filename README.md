# Mondrian Project

The Mondrian Project is a web design created solely using HTML and CSS. Inspired by the abstract geometric style of Piet Mondrian, this project emphasizes clean lines, bold primary colors, and the use of grid layouts to create visually striking compositions. The design is simple yet artistic, showcasing the power of minimalism and pure CSS for layout control.
